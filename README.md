# crypto_analysis
# Overview

This program is a python script that reads the top cryptocurrencies from coinmarketcap.com, sorts them, and saves them in a file to be read in the program later.

# Data Analysis Results

This program helped me see exactly how certain newer cryptocurrencies compared to eachother in this long, sorted list. We often only see the few that are at the top, and not those that are in the middle.

# Development Environment

I used Python 3.9 with VScode and Vim for this project.

# Python Libraries

Beautiful Soup - Web scraping

Requests - Accessing links

OS - Saving images

JSON - handling JSON while reading a file

Pandas - Data analysis and dataframes

# Future Work

I would like to add more functionality to this like using matplotlib to compare how certain cryptocurrencies are doing on a specific day, but there are a few data points that are very difficult to extract from the website.
